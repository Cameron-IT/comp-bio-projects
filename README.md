# comp-bio-projects
A collection of my personal computational biology projects. I have always been interested in computational methods, and my major course of study has been in biological sciences (BSc in Life Science and MSc in Pharmacology). I find the intersection of fields to be where some of the most interesting discoveries and advancements are made, so I thought to merge my passion for these two fields by undertaking some computational biology projects. I do these projects on my spare time out of pure interest. As such, they are not meant to be fully optimized all the time. If you see a problem with my code, please submit an issue. I'll be happy to work on solving it.
