    "# Local Sequence Alignment\n",
    "\n",
    "This is my first computational biology project. I was inspired to undertake this project after following the MIT open course called [Foundations of Computational and Systems Biology](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/biology/7-91j-foundations-of-computational-and-systems-biology-spring-2014/index.htm) by **Prof. Christopher Burge**. Much of my code was inspired by **Prof. Ben Langmead**, which can be found [here](https://github.com/BenLangmead/comp-genomics-class/blob/master/notebooks/CG_DP_Local.ipynb), and the Stackoverflow community. Here, I use the same sequences and scoring penalties as Prof. Langmead so i can cross-reference my output with his for correctness.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is it?\n",
    "Local sequence alignment takes two sequences and finds two sub sequences with the best alignment based on matching bases between the two sequences. The best alignment can have base matches (eg. G to G), missmatches (eg. G to A), or gaps (eg. G to -). A common strategy to determine local sequence alignment utilizes the Smith Waterman algorithm, which is described here [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smithâ€“Waterman_algorithm#Gap_penalty)."

    "I start by adding a couple of DNA sequences (sx and sy) for testing the algorithm, defining two arrays (one to keep track of the score (M) and another to keep track of the direction the score came from (P)), and creating a *SmithWaterman* function that fills both M and P arrays. This algoritm utilizes a linear gap penalty."
